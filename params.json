So I was tinkering with my OnePlus 2 and found some tweaks to share with the community. These tweaks are still a WIP (PM me if you want to test before I release publicly) and aim to improve battery life on SD 810 devices (not sure :p)(OP2 for sure :D ) without affecting performance at all.\r\n\r\nI will keep on updating with the new tweaks I find with time on the test branch and when I find it correct to release them publicly,they will be released on XDA and in stable branch.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
